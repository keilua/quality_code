/// <summary>
/// The submarine has an ExecuteCommand, which can receive a command (string).
/// * "down X" increases your aim by X units.
/// * "up X" decreases your aim by X units.
/// * "forward X" does two things:
///     - It increases your horizontal position by X units
///     - It increases your depth by your aim multiplied by X
/// (Note: that since you're on a submarine, down and up do the opposite of what you might expect: "down" means aiming in the positive direction.)
///
/// Here's an example
/// * forward 5 adds 5 to your horizontal position, a total of 5. Because your aim is 0, your depth does not change.
/// * down 5 adds 5 to your aim, resulting in a value of 5.
/// * forward 8 adds 8 to your horizontal position, a total of 13. Because your aim is 5, your depth increases by 8*5=40.
/// * up 3 decreases your aim by 3, resulting in a value of 2.
/// * down 8 adds 8 to your aim, resulting in a value of 10.
/// * forward 2 adds 2 to your horizontal position, a total of 15. Because your aim is 10, your depth increases by 2*10=20 to a total of 60.
/// After following these new instructions, you would have a horizontal position of 15 and a depth of 60.
///
/// Bonus: Load Input.txt and take your submarine to its course.
/// What result do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?
